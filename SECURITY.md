## Supported Versions

I currently maintain security updates for:

| Version | Supported          |

| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Found a security issue in Flare? Thanks for looking out! You can report it in two ways:

1. Click **Report a vulnerability** in the top right corner.

2. **Email**
   - If you prefer email: me@fl1nt.dev
   - Please include "SECURITY" in the subject

When reporting, it helps if you can provide:

- What the issue is
- How to reproduce it
- What could happen if exploited

## What Happens Next

Once you report something:

1. I'll confirm I received it when I can
2. I'll investigate and let you know what I find
3. Once fixed, I'll release a patch and credit you (if you want)

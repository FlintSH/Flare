### Docker Deployment (Self-Hosted)

1. Set up a PostgreSQL server and create a database for Flare.

2. Create a `.env` file with the following required variables:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname # (replace with your PostgreSQL connection string)
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key # (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # (or wherever you deploy Flare)
   ```

3. Run Flare using the pre-built Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name flare \
     -p 3000:3000 \
     --env-file .env \
     -v ./uploads:/app/uploads \
     flintsh/flare:latest
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 to complete the setup and create your admin account.

The official Docker image is available on Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry as `flintsh/flare`.
